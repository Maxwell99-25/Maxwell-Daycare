Problem It Solves:

Many local creches register learners manually using paper forms, which can:
- Get lost or damaged
- Be difficult to update
- Take too much time to manage

This project provides a simple digital solution for capturing and managing learner information.

Technologies Used
Frontend:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- LocalStorage (temporary data storage)

 Backend (Planned Upgrade)
- Node.js
- Express.js

Features:

- Learner registration form
- Data saved using JavaScript localStorage
- Principal login system
- Admin dashboard to:
  - View registered learners
  - Manage learner records
- Mobile-friendly UI

What I Learned:

- Solving real-world problems using code
- Using localStorage to persist data
- Building a simple authentication flow
- Creating an admin dashboard
- Deploying projects using GitHub Pages
- Version control with Git & GitHub

Planned Improvements
- Replace localStorage with a Node.js backend
- Handle registrations on the server
- Store data in a JSON file (no database initially)
- Improve authentication using backend logic
- Prepare for future database integration
